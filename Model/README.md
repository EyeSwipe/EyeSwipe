# Model

This directory contains the files pertinent to constructing our model. 'model.py' serves as a set
of building blocks for the type of model that we will be using.

### Files

* [test_model.py](test_model.py): A script that simply checks that a sample model can run without
	any faults.

	that can be made to it.
